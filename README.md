# minecraft-server-ping-example
this was inspired by this [gist](https://gist.github.com/vegeta897/e3d2fcd4b661bd9d021c397e7505be05)
I noticed alot of people were having issues creating a command to ping a minecraft server, and I had the same issues, so I made this template.
# Running the bot
1. first git clone or download a zip of this repo
(you need git and nodejs to run the bot)
2. run npm i 
3. edit index.js to your liking (server ip, embed, activity status... etc)
4. make sure to place your bot token in the last line of the script where client.login() is 
5. them run node . or node index.js 
6. profit, you should be all set!!
# Issues
if you have any issues or ideas tomake the template better feel free to drop a pr or issue!
